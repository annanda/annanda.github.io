      <description>Welcome! Hello, my name is Annanda. I&amp;rsquo;m was born in the Northeast of Brazil (Maranh√£o), and I lived for many years in Rio de Janeiro.
My father chose my name, and it means bliss: &amp;ldquo;perfect happiness, great joy&amp;rdquo;. Who knows me in person will agree that my name&amp;rsquo;s meaning describes me very well. I love to smile.
I have a degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) - the achievement I&amp;rsquo;m proudest of until this day.</description>
