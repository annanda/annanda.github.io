I was born in the Northeast of Brazil (Maranhão), and I lived for many years in Rio de Janeiro.
My father chose my name, and it means bliss: “perfect happiness, great joy”. Who knows me in person will agree that my name’s meaning describes me very well. I love to smile.
I have a degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) - the achievement I’m proudest of until this day.</description></item><item><title>What I'm doing now</title><link>https://annanda.github.io/now/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://annanda.github.io/now/</guid><description>On this page, you can find projects I&amp;rsquo;m involved with as of Sunday, 6th February 2022.
