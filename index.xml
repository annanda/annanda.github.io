I was born in the Northeast of Brazil (Maranhão), and I lived for many years in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My father chose my name, and it means &lt;em>bliss&lt;/em>: &amp;ldquo;perfect happiness, great joy&amp;rdquo;. Who knows me in person will agree that my name&amp;rsquo;s meaning describes me very well. I love to smile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) - the achievement I&amp;rsquo;m proudest of until this day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a PhD candidate at NUI Galway in Ireland. In my research, I&amp;rsquo;m investigating how to create a multimodal emotion detection system for children with autism. You can see my publications here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first contact with any kind of computer coding was with HTML, around the year 2001.&lt;br>
Around 2010, I enrolled in some courses in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. On that time I did a lot of websites using Wordpress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been programming using Python since 2014.
During some time, I was very active in the Brazillian Python community: I organised Python and Django workshops, I delivered presentations, I attended several Python Con Brazil and other local Python events. And I was a co-founder of Pyladies Rio back in 2015. I was also part of the Brazilian Python Association&amp;rsquo;s board (Associação Python Brasil) - that was before starting my PhD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my college times, I was an intern in two different industry companies. In the first one, I had an experience with Java web development, dealing with clients, and Ruby web development. During the second one, I had an experience with technical writing and Javascript development.
After that, I was an intern in a research centre, working on a European research project. That&amp;rsquo;s when I fell in love with research and decided to pursue a PhD degree. There, I worked with AI, machine learning and natural language processing. I was also involved in academic writing (paper and report writing), and I had the most amazing coworkers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m married to &lt;a href="https://arruda.blog.br/">Felipe&lt;/a>, we are together for more than ten years now! He is my favorite human being.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog, I write a bit about everything that I love: books, technology, programming, organising, productivity, photography and any other random obsession I might be hooked into at the moment. I always have at least one active obsession.&lt;/p>
