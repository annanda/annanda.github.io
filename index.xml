I completed another Hacktoberfest challenge this year and I&amp;rsquo;ll get a nice t-shirt with that lovely logo &amp;lt;3 to
celebrate it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest&lt;/a> is a yearly month-long event organised by Digital Ocean to celebrate and support the open-source software
community. During October, you can join the event and collaborate on open-source software projects by submitting pull
requests (PR). Once you have submitted and being approved 4 PRs, you might get some nice appreciation tokens (i.e.
t-shirt, stickers, or plant a tree).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the third time I join the event and every time is really fun! The first time I joined was during a Python Con
Brazil, with Pyladies girls, we were working on the Pyladies Brazil website. We were all in the same room, it was so fun - great memories. The following year I joined the event with &lt;a href="https://arruda.blog.br/">Felipe&lt;/a> and we worked on each other blogs if I&amp;rsquo;m not
mistaken. Then I skipped one year, and this year I worked on one of Felipe&amp;rsquo;s projects called &lt;a href="https://github.com/arruda/ScaPi">ScaPi&lt;/a>, a game project he
created to explain some concepts of multi-threading to students. I created some boards for the game and also got an idea
and implemented a whole new module in which you have a user interface to create and edit boards for the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday the PR&amp;rsquo;s evaluation period finished and I got to select a t-shirt as a prize. Yaaaay! Now I just need to wait
until it gets to me. It is always good to be part of those events, to collaborate and to learn. And in the end, to walk
around with a nice t-shirt that also serves as a starting topic conversation with people. :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact me</title><link>https://annanda.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:04:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://annanda.github.io/contact/</guid><description>&lt;p>You can email me, I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to hear from you.&lt;/p>

I was born in the Northeast of Brazil (Maranhão), and I lived for many years in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My father chose my name, and it means &lt;em>bliss&lt;/em>: &amp;ldquo;perfect happiness, great joy&amp;rdquo;. Who knows me in person will agree that my name&amp;rsquo;s meaning describes me very well. I love to smile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) - the achievement I&amp;rsquo;m proudest of until this day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a PhD candidate at NUI Galway in Ireland. In my research, I&amp;rsquo;m investigating how to create a multimodal emotion detection system for children with autism. You can see my publications here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first contact with any kind of computer coding was with HTML, around the year 2001.&lt;br>
Around 2010, I enrolled in some courses in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. On that time I did a lot of websites using Wordpress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been programming using Python since 2014.
During some time, I was very active in the Brazillian Python community: I organised Python and Django workshops, I delivered presentations, I attended several Python Con Brazil and other local Python events. And I was a co-founder of Pyladies Rio back in 2015. I was also part of the Brazilian Python Association&amp;rsquo;s board (Associação Python Brasil) - that was before starting my PhD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my college times, I was an intern in two different industry companies. In the first one, I had an experience with Java web development, dealing with clients, and Ruby web development. During the second one, I had an experience with technical writing and Javascript development.
After that, I was an intern in a research centre, working on a European research project. That&amp;rsquo;s when I fell in love with research and decided to pursue a PhD degree. There, I worked with AI, machine learning and natural language processing. I was also involved in academic writing (paper and report writing), and I had the most amazing coworkers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m married to &lt;a href="https://arruda.blog.br/">Felipe&lt;/a>, we are together for more than ten years now! He is my favorite human being.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog, I write a bit about everything that I love: books, technology, programming, organising, productivity, photography and any other random obsession I might be hooked into at the moment. I always have at least one active obsession.&lt;/p>
